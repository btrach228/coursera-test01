PIPES.

Pipes allow to pass the output from one command as the input for another command.

Example:

Counter of words in text file.

cat file1.txt | wc -w

combining 2 files:


cat file1.txt file2.txt | wc -w

Redirection:

Types:
Standart Input - < - stdin -> 0 (f.ex mouse ):
Standart Output - > - stdout -> 1 (f.ex monitor )
Standart Error - 2> - stderr -> 2
